I would like to thank my internal supervisor and examiner at Luleå University of Technology (LTU), Tatiana Liakh, for steady guidance, clear feedback, and for helping me keep the scope realistic. I am especially grateful to my external supervisor at Softhouse, Axel Lassinantti, whose advice, reviews, and day-to-day help shaped the project; this thesis would not have come together without his support.

I also thank Metria AB for hosting the work and providing access to their platform and data. In particular, I am grateful to Erik Wikström at Metria for preparing datasets, answering many practical questions, and reviewing intermediate results throughout the project. Softhouse deserves thanks for connecting me with Metria and for offering a great workspace during the project.

Finally, I want to thank my classmates and friends, Elliot Wallin, Suad Huseynli, and Magnus Stenfelt, for carefully reading drafts and providing feedback.
